1. The operator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should not return a reference to a Fraction object (like operator+=). 
--> the operator + does not reference to a Fraction because when it is leaving the function, the object is out os scope and thus it no longer exits.

List the temporary objects in the tester module (the temporary objects are those that have no name and are removed from memory immediately after their creation; put messages in the constructors/destructor to reveal them). 
--> The temporary objects are the ones created under the operator functions. such as result, current and etc.


3. List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize duplication. 
-->Within the operator functions, I called any existing ones where appropriate to minimize code duplications.

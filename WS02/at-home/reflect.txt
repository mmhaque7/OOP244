1) Why do you need to allocate new dynamic memory for the entire array
when you increase the size of an existing array of dynamically allocated
memory? Why not allocate memory only for the new element?

-->we needed to allocate another dynamic memory because of pPhones already has a set dedicated memory thus we need more memory before using it again. We do not allocate memory for a new element in our main code the display function needs all the data and creating a new memory of it would make the code longer instead we make our original memory larger.

2)The CellPhone structure stores the model of the cellphone in an array of
characters. At the end of the program, we do not use the delete operator
to deallocate the memory occupied by the model. Why don’t we need to
use the delete operator on this array itself? Explain and compare with the
array of cellphones.?

--> We do not deallocate the array itself because we are deallocating the pointer.

3) There are two display(...) function definitions. How does the compiler know which definition to call from your main function?

--> The Compiler knows which display() function to call by examining the types of the parameter requested.
